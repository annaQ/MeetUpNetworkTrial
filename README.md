MeetUpNetworkTrial
==================
This is a trial of R-shiny on the data retrieved from MeetUp.com with their event API.
The first tab shows how active people are on MeetUp in each state.
The second tab shows the events happening in a certain area.
The last tab shows the location of each event.
